                My signal processing class was inspiring. Really, a simple filter
                and a little bit of math magic is all it takes to talk to someone
                on the other side of the world? To stream music and videos to entertain
                millions around the world? To take an image and magically make it
                hundreds of times more compact, but look almost exactly the same?
                Now, THIS was something I could do to take my passions, the culmination
                of my work throughout school, and make a difference in the lives of
                the people and communities around me! That is, until I asked a professor
                who told me that the knowledge was outdated, niche, and only useful
                in an oversaturated sector. I was crushed. It had felt like nothing
                up until then mattered; the hundreds of assignments, the late night
                studying to prepare for headache-inducing exams, the frustration of
                grueling group projects. But soon after, a classmate told me something
                that stuck with me.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Everything you do matters. Every class you've taken, every experience
                you've had, every failure you undertook. It all comes around at some
                point to become useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                  “There is no such thing as wasted knowledge.”

                And just like that, a breath of life was added to my UW experience.
                Now, my journey through UW was about tackling new experiences and
                finding out more about myself and the world around me. I worked
                with Project Sidewalk to help develop software to identify accessibility
                issues in cities for those with disabilities. I joined the BCME
                lab, where I help design air sampling filters to catch and identify
                particulates in medical spaces and beyond. Diving into subjects
                both inside and out of my comfort zone, I still struggle with figuring
                out whether what I do is what has the most meaning behind it, or
                if I feel the most passionate about it. But one thing that I'm absolutely
                sure of, is that “There is no such thing as wasted knowledge.”
