            <p>
                My experiences growing through UW have made me into the person I
                am today.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The isolation of the pandemic pushed me to see the value
                in community and the need for meaning behind what I do in school.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                My time in Jazz Directory and Music for Charity showed me how to
                take my passions to achieve those ends, building and leading community
                within my peers and using those passions to meaningful ends.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                My struggles through coursework and my connection to my peers led me
                to understand the value of knowledge, no matter the subject.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                And my work as an Engineering Ambassador showed me the love of spreading
                that knowledge to those who have yet to see it.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I'm continuing to work with the BCME lab to research biomedical devices; I'll be hosting
                a jazz concert with Music for Charity to celebrate Black History Month;
                and I'm continuing to do outreach with Engineering Ambassadors to
                spread awareness of engineering and STEM to local youth. I've taken
                steps to continue a path towards STEM education and community building
                by taking education classes and planning more outreach events beyond
                Engineering Ambassadors. I'm still growing, still learning, and still
                searching for the limits of what makes meaning in what I do. But my goal
                is to make sure that my future self takes what I've learned, what
                I've experienced, to make meaning through building up the communities
                around me, whether it be advancing technology though my research,
                STEM education, or spreading the love of music.
