            <h2>Outreach and Education</h2>
            <p>
                An opening for a program called Engineering Ambassadors appeared
                before me. I had done outreach before: going back to my high school
                to jump-start their music program, playing music for elementary
                schools to convince them to pick up band or orchestra. But this
                was my first opportunity at STEM education. Just to join, I had
                to teach a lesson of any topic to a group of other students and
                staff. As I crafted my topic, teaching about music, I had to think
                about what my purpose, my audience, and what the subject matter was.
                Reflecting on these as I built my lesson, I began to realize that
                I really enjoyed teaching and educating. As I've worked as an
                Engineering Ambassador, I've had the chance to organize events,
                speak with students from all around the state, and work with other
                like-minded ambassadors. I'd found yet another community, and
                another passion, to be involved in and pursue.
